  # For 8.50+:
  # - Command Centre Server is 64-bit only.
  # - Configuration Client is still 32-bit in 8.50. In the future, it may be switched to 64-bit and 32-bit support may be removed.
  # - The customisation installer EXE is expected to run only on the server. Only the 64-bit installer EXE is needed.
  # - The customisation Setup package (.msi file) includes both the 64-bit and the 32-bit customisation files. Only one MSI installer is needed.
  # - Treat the x64 platform as the main platform and the x86 platform as an auxiliary platform (e.g. for producing the dependent files needed by the Setup project).
